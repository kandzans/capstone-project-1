    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p> As a newcomer to web development transitioning from a background in social sciences and public service, 
    I bring a unique perspective to the field. Currently expanding my skills in full-stack development, 
    starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My experience as a researcher and public servant has honed my 
    analytical mindset and attention to detail, qualities that I apply to coding projects. Additionally, 
    my role as a chef in a retirement house has instilled in me the importance of clear communication and empathy, 
    valuable assets in collaborative web development environments. Eager to continue learning and contribute to 
    meaningful web projects that enhance user experiences and accessibility.</p>
